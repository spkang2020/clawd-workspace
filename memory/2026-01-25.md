## CRM Project Work

### Google OAuth Setup (Gmail Integration)

- Client ID and Secret stored in environment variables
- Enabled Gmail API
- Added pkangsubs@gmail.com as test user (app in Testing mode)
- Redirect URI configured for local dev

### Railway Database

- Project: profound-learning
- Services: CRM-backend, CRM-frontend, Postgres

### Onboarding Quiz Feature (Built)
- Created `onboarding_responses` table (JSONB for flexibility)
- Backend routes: GET /status, POST /responses, POST /skip
- Frontend: OnboardingQuiz component with 4 questions
- Questions (all timing in weeks as requested):
  1. Follow-up timing (1-4 weeks)
  2. Re-engagement timing (4-12 weeks)
  3. Meeting prep time
  4. Weekly coffee chat capacity
- Data collection only - no product impact yet (per Peter's request)
- Shows after first login, skippable

### Gmail Integration Branch
- Branch name: `feature/gmail-integration` (not `gmail-integration`)
- Exists in: CRM-backend, CRM-frontend
- CRM-databse repo doesn't have this branch

### Bug Fix - Main Branch Crash
- Issue: `ReferenceError: allowedOrigins is not defined`
- Cause: Gmail integration merge accidentally deleted variable definitions
- Fixed: Added back `isProduction`, `generalLimiter`, `authLimiter`, `allowedOrigins`
- Pushed fix to main branch
