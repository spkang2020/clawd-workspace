## LinkedIn Prospect Scraping for SuperdayIQ

Gathered **200 students** from LinkedIn interested in investment banking:
- File: `~/clawd/ib-prospects-linkedin.csv`
- Columns: Name, School, Year, Notes, Tier
- Breakdown: 52 Target, 82 Semi-Target, 66 Other
- Years: 79 sophomores (2028), 72 freshmen (2029), 45 unknown

Search queries used:
- "class of 2028" "investment banking"
- "class of 2029" "investment banking"  
- "aspiring investment banker" student

**LinkedIn URLs not collected** — sub-agent failed due to browser timeouts. User may want to re-run.

## Browser Control Setup

Cev learned about browser access options:
1. **Chrome Extension Relay** (`profile="chrome"`) — attach to existing Chrome tabs, requires manual click on toolbar icon per tab
2. **Managed Browser** (`profile="clawd"`) — full control, separate browser instance, need to log in to sites

Cev chose option 2 (managed browser) for full access.

## Companies Page Redesign

Rebuilt Companies page using EmailImport design patterns:
- Compact grid rows (28px min-height)
- Shorter header labels: # | REF | OUT | IN | MTG | STAGE
- Same expandable hierarchy (Company → Department → Group → Contact)
- Committed: `f19eb6d2`

Issue raised: Header was wrapping to 2 rows — fixed with shorter labels.

## CRM Project Notes
