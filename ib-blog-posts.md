## 1. The Investment Banking Recruiting Timeline: What You Need to Know

Investment banking recruiting operates on a notoriously accelerated timeline that catches many students off guard. Understanding when things happen is half the battle.

**Summer Analyst Recruiting (Undergraduate)**

For juniors targeting summer 2025 internships, the timeline typically looks like this:

- **January-March**: Networking season begins. Start reaching out to alumni and building relationships.
- **April-May**: Applications open at many banks. Some start even earlier.
- **June-August**: First-round interviews (often Hirevue or phone screens).
- **August-September**: Superdays and final rounds.
- **September-October**: Offers extended.

Yes, you read that correctly. You're recruiting almost a full year before your internship starts.

**What This Means For You**

If you're a sophomore, start networking NOW. If you're a freshman, begin learning about the industry and building your resume. The students who land top offers aren't the ones who started preparing when applications opened—they're the ones who spent months building relationships beforehand.

**The Trend Toward Earlier Recruiting**

Each year, the timeline seems to creep earlier. Some banks now conduct "early insight" programs for sophomores and even freshmen. While this can feel overwhelming, it also creates opportunities. These programs are less competitive and can give you a significant advantage when formal recruiting begins.

## 2. Networking 101: How to Reach Out to Bankers Without Being Annoying

Let's be honest: bankers receive dozens of networking emails every week. Most get ignored. Here's how to stand out.

**The Anatomy of a Good Cold Email**

```
Subject: Columbia Junior - Quick Question About Your Path to [Bank Name]

Hi [First Name],

I'm a junior at Columbia studying Economics, and I came across your profile while researching analysts at [Bank Name]. I noticed you also came from a liberal arts background before transitioning to banking, and I'd love to hear how you made that switch.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call sometime in the next few weeks? I'm flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works**

1. **Specific subject line**: Shows you did your research
2. **Brief introduction**: They can assess fit in seconds
3. **Personalized hook**: References something specific about them
4. **Clear ask**: 15 minutes, flexible timing
5. **Professional but warm tone**: Not robotic, not too casual

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Sending a novel (keep it under 150 words)
- Generic templates that could be sent to anyone
- Asking for a job in your first email
- Following up aggressively (once after a week is fine)
- Connecting on LinkedIn without context

**The Follow-Up**

If you don't hear back after a week, one polite follow-up is acceptable:

"Hi [Name], I wanted to follow up on my note below. I know you're busy, so no worries if the timing doesn't work—I appreciate you considering it either way."

Then move on. Persistence becomes pestering after two attempts.

## 3. What Bankers Actually Look For in Coffee Chats

You secured the call. Now what? Many students treat coffee chats as interviews, drilling the banker with questions. That's a mistake.

**The Real Purpose of Coffee Chats**

Coffee chats serve two functions:
1. For you to learn about the role and firm
2. For the banker to assess if they'd want to work with you

Notice that second part. This isn't a one-way information download. The banker is evaluating whether you're someone they'd want on their team at 2 AM working on a pitch book.

**What They're Actually Assessing**

- **Genuine interest**: Do you actually want this, or are you checking a box?
- **Preparation**: Did you do basic research, or are you asking things you could Google?
- **Social skills**: Can you hold a conversation? Are you pleasant to talk to?
- **Coachability**: Do you listen, or do you just wait for your turn to talk?

**Questions That Impress**

- "I read that [Bank] has been growing its healthcare practice. How has that affected deal flow in your group?"
- "What's something you wish you'd known before starting as an analyst?"
- "How would you describe the culture difference between [Bank] and other firms you considered?"

**Questions That Don't**

- "What does an investment banker do?"
- "What are the hours like?" (You know what they're like.)
- "Can you refer me for a position?"

**The Thank You Note**

Send it within 24 hours. Keep it brief, reference something specific from the conversation, and don't ask for anything.

## 4. Breaking Into IB From a Non-Target School

Let's address the elephant in the room: school pedigree matters in IB recruiting. But it's not the whole story.

**The Reality**

Yes, banks recruit heavily from target schools (think Wharton, Harvard, Princeton). Yes, you'll face additional hurdles from a non-target. No, it's not impossible—far from it.

**What Non-Target Students Must Do Differently**

1. **Network twice as hard**: You don't have the alumni network handing you interviews. Build one manually.

2. **Be technically flawless**: Target students can sometimes coast on pedigree. You can't. Know your technicals cold.

3. **Have a compelling story**: Why banking? Why you? Your narrative needs to be tight.

4. **Leverage any connection**: Hometown contacts, family friends, LinkedIn connections—use everything.

5. **Consider the side door**: Boutiques, middle-market banks, and regional firms are more accessible and can be stepping stones.

**Paths That Work**

- **Boutique first**: Firms like Lazard, Evercore, and Centerview hire from non-targets, and MM banks are even more accessible.
- **Big 4 to banking**: Start in transaction advisory at Deloitte/PwC/EY/KPMG, then lateral.
- **Industry coverage angle**: Deep expertise in a sector (healthcare, tech, energy) can differentiate you.

**The Mindset Shift**

Stop thinking "I can't break in from a non-target." Start thinking "I need to work differently than target students." The hustle is different, not impossible.

## 5. Technical Interview Prep: The 20% That Gets You 80% of the Way

You don't need to know everything. You need to know the right things extremely well.

**The Core Concepts (Master These)**

1. **Three Financial Statements**
   - How they link together
   - What happens when you change one line item

2. **Valuation**
   - DCF (walk through step by step)
   - Comparable companies
   - Precedent transactions
   - When to use each

3. **Accounting**
   - D&A and its impact
   - Working capital changes
   - Deferred taxes basics

4. **M&A**
   - Accretion/dilution
   - Sources and uses
   - Why companies merge

5. **LBO**
   - Basic mechanics
   - What drives returns
   - Paper LBO

**The Questions You'll Definitely Get**

- Walk me through a DCF
- Walk me through an LBO
- How do the three financial statements link?
- What happens to each statement when depreciation increases by $10?
- Company A buys Company B—walk me through the accounting

**How to Prepare**

1. **Start with the Wall Street Oasis guides**—they're free and comprehensive
2. **Practice out loud**—you need to articulate, not just understand
3. **Get a study buddy**—quiz each other relentlessly
4. **Do 2-3 practice interviews**—with friends, alumni, or paid services

**The Secret**

Interviewers care less about perfect answers and more about structured thinking. If you don't know something, say "I'm not certain, but here's how I'd think about it..." and walk through your logic.

## 6. Behavioral Interview Questions: What They Really Want to Hear

"Tell me about yourself" isn't an invitation to recite your resume. It's a test.

**The Framework for "Tell Me About Yourself"**

Structure it as past → present → future:

1. **Past**: Quick background (school, major, relevant experience)
2. **Present**: What you're doing now and why it's relevant
3. **Future**: Why investment banking, why this firm

Keep it under 2 minutes. Practice until it sounds natural, not rehearsed.

**The "Why Investment Banking?" Trap**

Wrong answers:
- "I want to make a lot of money" (even though true)
- "I want to learn a lot" (too vague)
- "I've always been interested in finance" (prove it)

Better framework:
- Connect to specific experiences that led you here
- Show you understand what the job actually entails
- Demonstrate genuine intellectual curiosity about deals/markets

**Behavioral Questions They Love**

- Tell me about a time you led a team
- Describe a conflict and how you resolved it
- Tell me about a failure
- Why should we hire you over other candidates?

**The STAR Method (But Make It Natural)**

- **Situation**: Brief context
- **Task**: Your specific responsibility
- **Action**: What YOU did (not your team)
- **Result**: Quantify if possible

Don't be robotic about it. Weave these elements into a compelling story.

**The Secret to Behavioral Interviews**

Have 4-5 strong stories that you can adapt to any question. Know them cold, but tell them like you're sharing with a friend, not reciting a script.

## 7. The Art of the Follow-Up: Staying Top of Mind Without Being Desperate

You had a great coffee chat. You sent the thank you note. Now what?

**The Mistake Most Students Make**

They either:
1. Never follow up again (out of sight, out of mind)
2. Follow up constantly (annoying)

Both kill your chances.

**The Right Cadence**

- **Immediately after**: Thank you email (within 24 hours)
- **2-3 weeks later**: Share something relevant (article, news about their firm)
- **When something changes**: You got an offer elsewhere, finished a relevant project, have a legitimate update
- **Before recruiting heats up**: Quick check-in to stay fresh in their mind

**What Good Follow-Ups Look Like**

```
Hi [Name],

I saw [Bank] just closed the [Deal Name] transaction—congrats to the team! I remember you mentioned healthcare was becoming a bigger focus. Would love to hear how things have been going when you have a moment.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

This shows:
- You're paying attention to their work
- You remember your conversation
- You're not asking for anything

**Building a System**

Track every interaction in a spreadsheet or CRM:
- Who you talked to
- When you last reached out
- What you discussed
- When to follow up next

This isn't being calculating—it's being organized. Relationships take maintenance.

## 8. Superday Survival Guide: What to Expect and How to Prepare

You made it to Superday. This is where it gets real.

**What Superday Actually Is**

A Superday (or "final round") typically involves:
- 4-6 back-to-back interviews
- Mix of technical and behavioral questions
- Usually at the bank's office
- Decisions within a week

**The Physical Preparation**

- Get a good suit (navy or charcoal, well-fitted)
- Prepare multiple copies of your resume
- Know where you're going and arrive 15 minutes early
- Eat breakfast—you'll need the energy

**The Mental Preparation**

- Review your technical prep the night before, but don't cram
- Re-read your resume—they'll ask about anything on it
- Research your interviewers if you know who they are
- Prepare 3-4 thoughtful questions about the group/firm

**During the Day**

- **Be consistent**: Tell the same stories to each interviewer
- **Be enthusiastic**: Energy matters, especially by interview 5
- **Be yourself**: They're assessing culture fit too
- **Take notes**: After each interview, jot down what was asked

**The Interviews You'll Face**

- **Technical grilling**: One interviewer will stress test your knowledge
- **Behavioral deep dive**: Another will focus on fit and stories
- **Case study**: Some include a mini-case or paper LBO
- **Culture chat**: Often a more senior banker just getting to know you

**After the Day**

Send personalized thank you notes to each interviewer within 24 hours. Reference something specific from each conversation.

## 9. Offer Negotiation and Decision-Making: Playing the End Game

You have an offer. Maybe multiple. Now comes the hard part.

**Can You Negotiate?**

For analyst positions: barely. Compensation is largely standardized. You might negotiate:
- Start date
- Signing bonus timing
- Group placement (if you have leverage)

Don't try to negotiate base salary—it'll come across as naive.

**Exploding Offers**

Many banks give "exploding offers"—accept within X days or lose it. This is controversial but common. Your options:
- Accept and renege later (burns bridges, but people do it)
- Ask for an extension (sometimes granted, sometimes not)
- Accept if it's your top choice anyway

**Choosing Between Offers**

Consider:
1. **Group placement**: What deals will you work on?
2. **Culture**: Where did you feel most comfortable?
3. **Exit opportunities**: Where do people go after?
4. **Training**: Especially important for your first role
5. **Location**: If you have options

**The Prestige Trap**

Don't just take the most "prestigious" offer. A good culture fit at a strong boutique beats a miserable experience at a bulge bracket. You'll be working 80+ hours a week—like the people you'll be with.

**Making the Decision**

Talk to people who've worked at each firm. Ask specific questions:
- What's the staffing model like?
- How much responsibility do analysts get?
- What's the culture really like at 2 AM?

Then trust your gut.

## 10. What to Do If You Don't Get an Offer: Pivots and Plan B's

Rejection happens. To almost everyone. Here's how to handle it.

**First: Process It**

It's okay to be disappointed. Take a day to feel frustrated. Then move forward. One rejection—or even a whole cycle of rejections—doesn't define your career.

**Analyze What Went Wrong**

Honestly assess:
- Did you network enough?
- Were your technicals solid?
- How did your interviews feel?
- Did you apply to enough places?

Get feedback if you can. Some interviewers will share what you could improve.

**Immediate Options**

1. **Keep recruiting**: Some banks have late-cycle openings. Boutiques often recruit later.
2. **Off-cycle recruiting**: Many banks hire throughout the year for various needs.
3. **Other finance roles**: Equity research, corporate banking, valuation—all can be stepping stones.

**The Lateral Path**

Many successful bankers didn't get in through the front door:
- Big 4 TAS → Banking
- Valuation firms → Banking
- Corporate finance → Banking
- MBA → Banking

A non-linear path isn't a worse path.

**Long-Term Perspective**

Your career is 40+ years. Whether you start in IB at 21 or 25 matters far less than you think. What matters is that you keep developing skills, building relationships, and staying persistent.

**The Mindset**

Recruiting is a numbers game with high variance. Smart, qualified people get rejected all the time due to factors outside their control. Keep going.
