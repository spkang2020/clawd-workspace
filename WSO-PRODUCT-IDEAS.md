# Product Ideas from WSO Research

*Compiled from browsing Wall Street Oasis IB forum threads*

## 🎯 What WSO Already Has (Competition)

**WSO Application Tracker** (https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/academy/dashboard/tracker):
- Filter by: Industry, Company, Company Type (BB/EB/MM), Group/Division, Region, Role Type, Undergrad Year
- **Premium**: Real-time crowdsourced status updates ("Offers are out!")
- Full-time staff updating new roles
- Coverage across all regions (US, UK, APAC, Europe, MENA)

**Gap**: WSO is application-focused, not networking/relationship-focused. Your CRM can own the **networking layer**.

## 🔥 High-Priority Ideas (Based on WSO Pain Points)

### 1. **Networking Effectiveness Tracker**
WSO users debate whether networking even matters (especially UK vs US). Track:
- Contacts reached out to → Referrals received → Interviews → Offers
- Prove ROI of networking with data
- Regional comparison (US networking matters more than UK)

### 2. **"When to Give Up" Dashboard**
From the "when to give up / start casing" thread - students need:
- Timeline of when firms typically extend offers
- "You're still in the game" reassurance vs realistic expectations
- Track firms that hire late (Jan/Feb for SA positions)

### 3. **Burnout Prevention**
- Activity pacing suggestions ("You've sent 50 cold emails this week - take a break")
- Mental health check-ins during recruiting season
- Celebrate small wins (got a reply, scheduled a call)

### 4. **Crowdsourced Offer Tracking**
Like WSO but better:
- "Offers out" alerts when X users mark received offer
- Historical data: "GS typically sends offers 48h after superday"
- Compare your timeline to others anonymously

### 5. **Referral Outcome Tracking**
- Did the referral actually help? Track: Referral → Interview → Outcome
- Show which contacts give referrals that convert
- "Your referrals have a 23% interview conversion rate"
